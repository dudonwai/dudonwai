Compound Interest

“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.” - Supposedly Einstein
Most people who refer to this quotation apply it to financial capital (ex. $10k invested 10 years ago could be $20k now)
Also dividends, which can be reinvested back into the network
Although "Einstein may not have said it", https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/10/31/compound-interest/  
But whoever did understood the power of feedback loops.
Feedback loops create capital, which helps acquire more capital, which acquires even more capital. But! You need capital to start
In fact, Einstein's fame for his ground-breaking research in relativity theory is itself an example of feedback loops. Someone hears it, someone believes it, and they spread it.

Capital Isn’t Just Financial

But the feedback loop applies to many other types of capital too.

Do Things That Don’t Scale

That’s why doing things that don’t scale, actually end up scaling. The feedback loop isn’t very valuable if you don’t have much to start with. You have to get the flywheel moving, and the best way to do that is to get things done.
